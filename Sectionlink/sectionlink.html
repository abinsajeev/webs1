        <h2>HTTP - HTTP REQUEST</h2>
        <img src="httprequest.png" alt="" style="margin-left: 150px;">
        <p>An HTTP request is a message sent by a client (e.g., a web browser) to a server to request a resource or perform an action. This request initiates the client-server communication in the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) model. 
        An HTTP request typically consists of the following components:</p>
        <p>Request Line:
        HTTP Method (or Verb): Specifies the action to be performed on the resource (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH).
        Request Target (URL): The specific address of the resource being requested.
        HTTP Version: Indicates the version of HTTP being used (e.g., HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2).</p>
        <p>HTTP Request Headers:
        Provide additional information about the request, the client, or the desired response. Examples include User-Agent, Accept, Content-Type, and Authorization.
        </p>
        <p>HTTP Request Body (Optional):
        Contains data sent to the server, primarily used with methods like POST and PUT for actions such as submitting form data or uploading files.</p>
        <ul>
        Common HTTP Request Methods:
        <li>GET: Retrieves data from a specified resource.</li>
        <li>POST: Sends data to a server to create or update a resource.</li>
        <li>PUT: Replaces the entire content of a resource at a given URL with the provided data.</li>
        <li>PATCH: Partially modifies the data of a resource.</li>
        <li>DELETE: Removes a specified resource from the server.</li>
        <li> HEAD: Requests a response identical to a GET request but without the response body, primarily used to retrieve headers.</li>
        <li>OPTIONS: Describes the communication options for the target resource.</li>
        </ul>

    <div id="section-5">
        <h2>DYNAMIC WEB PAGES</h2>
        <img src="dynamic-website-in-php-1.webp" alt="" style="margin-left: 200px;">
        <p>A dynamic web page is a web page whose content and/or layout can change and adapt based on various factors, such as user interaction, data retrieved from a database, or other real-time information. Unlike static web pages, which deliver the same pre-built content to every visitor, dynamic pages are generated or modified at the time of the user's request.
        Key characteristics of dynamic web pages:</p>
        <p>Content Variability:
        They can display different content to different users or at different times, based on factors like user preferences, location, search history, or database updates.
        </p>
        <p>Interactivity:
        They often incorporate interactive elements, allowing users to input information, submit forms, or trigger actions that modify the page's content or functionality.
        </p>
        <p>Data Integration:
        They frequently connect to databases or external data sources to retrieve and display information dynamically, such as product listings, news articles, or user profiles.
        </p>
        <p>Server-Side and/or Client-Side Scripting:
        Dynamic functionality is achieved through programming languages and scripts, which can be executed on the server (e.g., PHP, Python, Node.js) to generate HTML before sending it to the browser, or on the client-side (e.g., JavaScript) to manipulate the page after it has loaded in the user's browser.
        </p> 
        <ul>
            <p>Examples of dynamic web pages:</p>
            <li>E-commerce websites with personalized product recommendations.</li>
            <li>Social media feeds that update with new posts.</li>
            <li>News websites displaying the latest articles.</li>
            <li>Web applications with user-specific dashboards or content.</li>
